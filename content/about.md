Hi, and welcome to whatever this is. At the moment it mostly contains links to various online profiles, my email, and my CV. If I ever feel the need to share or show off something I'll probably publish it here, but don't hold your breath. 

The person responsible for this web site is me, Øyvind Klåpbakken. I graduated from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in January 2020 with a master's degree from the study programme *Applied Physics and Mathematics*. During the last few years of my studies I mainly focused on statistics, and I ended up writing a master's thesis (available [here](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2656712)) on map matching using hidden Markov models. I enjoy messing around with data using tools such as Python, R and SQL. That is why I currently work in insurance as a data scientist. 

When I'm not working you'll likely find me playing video games (check out my [Steam profile](steamcommunity.com/id/klaapbakken) to see all the games I've bought and played for two hours before never touching again). You might also find me watching movies or listening to music. If you wanna know what kind of music I'm listening to you can check out my [Discogs collection](https://www.discogs.com/user/klaapbakken/collection) or my [Last.fm profile](https://www.last.fm/user/klaapbakken). If you're into running and want to feel good about yourself you can check out (and maybe even follow!) me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/46823001).

Feel free to contact me using any of the links provided on the home page.
