Hi, and welcome to whatever this is. At the moment it mostly contains links to my social profiles, my email, and my CV, but I am hoping that I will be able to write a few occasional blog posts going forward.

The person responsible for this web site is me, Øyvind Klåpbakken. I graduated from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in January 2020 with a Master's degree from the study programme *Applied Physics and Mathematics*. My specializaion is statistics, and I wrote my Master's thesis on map matching using hidden Markov models. I'm very excited about the field of data science, and I am passionate about deriving insight from data by combining data visualization, statistical techniques and machine learning. I also enjoy programming quite a lot, and consider myself to be proficient in both R and Python.
