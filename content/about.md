I'm a 5th year student at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and an aspiring data scientist. I'm passionate about deriving insight from data by combining data visualization, statistical techniques and machine learning. I'm proficient in R and Python and I'm always excited to learn about new tools that will allow me to work more efficiently, obtain deeper insights and extract more value from the data I'm working with.
